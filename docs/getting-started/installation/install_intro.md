# Before you install

Pckd uses IP Registry to geo-locate users. You could learn more about why we use IP Registry [here](/docs/why-ip-registry)

You will need to **obtain an API key** from [ipregistry.co](https://ipregistry.co). Save the API Key for later use.

Now you could _proceed to the installation_.
