# Why [IP Registry](https://ipregistry.co)

IP Registry was a great choice when compared to other paid alternatives, since it provides [100,000 free lookups](https://ipregistry.co/pricing) and no monthly fees.

However, due to lack of awareness about other alternatives like Maxmind's free offerings, it is not a decision that goes well with the philosophy of the project. Due to this reason, V2 is expected to ship with a different geo-location API which is more stable and easy to setup.
